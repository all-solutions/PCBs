# DALY-BMS-to-MQTT-PCB

We don't just invest time in the project. You don't want to know how many Wemos or other components are already lying in the scrap garbage can. Or also measuring instruments. If something "ticks" you don't get it out without e.g. a Logic-Analyzer (ca. 550€) or an Oszilloscope. In short: with it the own costs are covered a little bit. We don't even talk about the many evenings and nights that we have to spend when there is an "urgent" problem somewhere.

For those of you who prefer to have a ready-made PCB instead of getting and soldering everything yourself, we now offer ready-made and tested PCB's **as a solderless DIY kit** for a small donation. These are then already loaded with the latest firmware.

You can simply plug the cable supplied with the BT dongle (Micro-USB) into the corresponding socket on the PCB (not the Wemos). With most BMSs, no additional power supply is necessary either.

The donation amount is 25€ per PCB plus shipping.

**Update 21.04.2023:**

The PCB's have -finally- arrived today. All pre-orders will now be processed and shipped over the weekend. Who still wants to have one now, can donate with pleasure. 10 PCB's are currently still available. What goes beyond that would have to wait until the next order and delivery.
